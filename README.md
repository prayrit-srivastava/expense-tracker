<h2>Expense Tracker Project</h2>
In this endeavor, I aimed to develop an expense tracker that enables users to log both positive and negative financial transactions. Additionally, the web application displays the overall balance, as well as profit and loss summaries. To achieve this, I utilized functional components to construct the necessary elements and leveraged the useReducer hook to centralize the updating mechanisms.
